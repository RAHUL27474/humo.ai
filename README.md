## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
```env
# Required - OpenRouter API for AI responses
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Required - Supabase for authentication
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url-here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key-here

# Optional - For enhanced features
VITE_ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your-eleven-labs-api-key-here
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
VITE_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your-assemblyai-api-key-here
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will work with free transcription services out of the box! Only the OpenRouter API key and Supabase configuration are required.

## Deployment

### Netlify Deployment

1. **Connect your repository to Netlify**
2. **Set environment variables in Netlify**:
   - Go to Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment variables
   - Add your API keys with the same names as in `.env`
3. **Deploy**: Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Sign in with email/password or Google account
2. **Voice Input**: Click the microphone and speak naturally
3. **Transcription**: Audio is automatically transcribed using available services
4. **Emotion Analysis**: Voice features are extracted and analyzed
5. **AI Response**: OpenRouter generates an empathetic response
6. **Voice Output**: Response is spoken back using TTS

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication
- **Supabase Auth**: Secure user authentication
- **Email/Password**: Traditional sign-up and sign-in
- **Google OAuth**: One-click social authentication

### Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API**: Browser-native audio recording and analysis
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Intelligent silence detection
- **Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive audio analysis

### AI Integration
- **OpenRouter API**: For generating empathetic responses
- **Multiple Transcription APIs**: Automatic fallback system
- **Eleven Labs/Web Speech**: High-quality text-to-speech

### State Management
- **React Hooks**: Modern state management
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with Web Audio API support
- Microphone permissions required
- HTTPS recommended for production deployment
